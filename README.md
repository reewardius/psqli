## Usage/Examples

```javascript
usage: hbsqli.py [-h] [-l LIST] [-u URL] -p PAYLOADS -H HEADERS [-v]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIST, --list LIST  To provide list of urls as an input
  -u URL, --url URL     To provide single url as an input
  -p PAYLOADS, --payloads PAYLOADS
                        To provide payload file having Blind SQL Payloads with delay of 30 sec
  -H HEADERS, --headers HEADERS
                        To provide header file having HTTP Headers which are to be injected
  -v, --verbose         Run on verbose mode
  -a, --approve         Pause and wait for approval if a vulnerability is found
```
### For Single URL:
```javascript
$ python3 hbsqli.py -u "https://target.com" -p payloads.txt -H headers.txt -v
```
### For List of URLs:
```javascript
$ python3 hbsqli.py -l urls.txt -p payloads.txt -H headers.txt -v
```
### Modes
There are basically two modes in this, **verbose** which will show you all the process which is happening and show your the status of each test done and **non-verbose**, which will just print the vulnerable ones on the screen.
To initiate the verbose mode just add **-v** in your command

### Notes
* You can use the provided payload file or use a custom payload file, just remember that delay in each payload in the payload file should be set to **30 seconds**.

* You can use the provided headers file or even some more custom header in that file itself according to your need.
